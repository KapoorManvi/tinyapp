# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). This application was built by Manvi Kapoor in the year 2020 during the Covid19 pandemic. Since she had to stay home, she figured she'd be productive and that's how this app was born. This is Manvi's first application. It isn't pretty, but it works and the error messages have personality. Enjoy!
